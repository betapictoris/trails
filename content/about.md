Before I created Haihaus Trails I was tired of all the other online trail sites which had noisy, suboptimal, user-uploaded information. I found that I would get data recorded off of someone else's Garmin, with all of the margin-of-error that it had, and found myself downloading massive shape files from the NPS, USFS, or local counties then using a GIS to create individual GPXs &ndash; it's a lot more work, but the data is accurate and comes from an official source. I created Haihaus Trails because I figured that if I was creating the files I mine as well share them with others anyway.
