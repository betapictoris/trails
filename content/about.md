Before I created Haihaus Trails I was tired of all the other online trail sites,
which where high commercialized for free data and had suboptimal user-uploaded
data. Although the apps had amazing community aspects, all I really wanted was
high-quality trail information. That's why I started downloading the data from
official sources who manage the trails, such as the National Park Service,
United States Forest Service, or local counties.

## What happens under the hood?

Once the data is downloaded the independent segments of the trail need to be
extracted and then merged together to create a single file. Then that data is
exported to `geojson`, `GPX`, and `KML` files, after the hike I write the guide
with extra information that the files don't give.
